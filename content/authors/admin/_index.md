Hi! My name is Yixiao Li. I am currently pursuing my master’s degree in Robotics, Systems and Control at ETH Zurich. I graduated from Tsinghua University in 2022. After that, I worked as a research assistant at the Hong Kong Centre For Logistics Robotics/CUHK T Stone Robotics Institute. 

My research interests lie in optimization and deep learning with applications in manipulation tasks for robotics. Apart from research, I also enjoy hiking and photography.
